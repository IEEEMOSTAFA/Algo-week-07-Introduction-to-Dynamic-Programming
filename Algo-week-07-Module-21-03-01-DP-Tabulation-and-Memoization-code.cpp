Dp-Use-Technique

1->Define State
2->Identify the recursive eqn from the smaller sub-problem
3->Define the base case

Dp-solving way ::::::1--Memoization/Recursive/Top-Down
                     2--Tabulation/Iterative/Botom-UP



Memoization:1->handle base case
            2->If current state already solved return the result 
            3.calculate the result from smaller sub problem.


Tabulation: 1->handle the base case
            2->lopp through the state 
            3->and calculate the answer from smaller sub-problem
